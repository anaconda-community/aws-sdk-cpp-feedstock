  summary: C++ library that makes it easy to integrate C++ applications with AWS services
  description: |
    The AWS SDK for C++ provides a modern C++ (version C++ 11 or later) interface for Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    It is meant to be performant and fully functioning with low- and high-level SDKs,
    while minimizing dependencies and providing platform portability (Windows, OSX, Linux, and mobile).
